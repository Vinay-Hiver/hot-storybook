# THINGS TO BE FIXED

Items that were found or discussed and deliberately left for later. Newest first. Nothing here is started.

## 0. Token audit: colors and typography (found 2026-10-02, nothing fixed yet)

Goal: no component uses a color or a font value that is not a defined token.

**Colors.** Every `var(--...)` reference resolves to a real token (353 tokens, none undefined). Hard-coded color values remaining:
- `MainNav.tsx` Hiver logo yellow `#FDB022` (no token in Figma). Added 2026-10-07.
- `src/index.css`, `App.css` (leftover Vite starter styles, unused by components) and `.storybook/hotTheme.ts` (Storybook UI theme) also hold raw colors. Not part of the design system; delete or leave.
- `Radio.css:4` `#6b778c` (group label). Not bound to a variable in Figma.
- `Radio.css:61` and `ListItem.css:56` `#fafbfc` (inner dot of a selected radio). Raw in Figma.
- `Loader.css:10-11` `#000`. Only used as a mask, never visible, but still a literal.
- Also `foundations/Colors.stories.tsx:18` uses `#0f172a` and `#ffffff` for label contrast on the Colors page.
- Done 2026-10-03: the required asterisk now uses the one token `errorBorderDefault` (`#e42525`) in Input, Textarea, Radio and Checkbox, matching the updated Text Input in Figma. Open in Figma: the Textarea Input asterisk and the Radio asterisk are still bound to variables from another library, and the asterisk text style (`body/md/medium`, Inter) is not a HOT text style.

**Typography.** The 12 Figma text styles exist only as CSS classes (`.text-label-small` and so on), and there are no CSS variables for them. No component uses those classes. Every component writes its font as literals (`font: weight size/line-height family`).
- 44 `font:` declarations across component and story files. 34 equal one of the Figma text styles but are written as literals. 10 match no text style (all are the 12px/16px medium helper label in the stories).
- Added 2026-10-07: the Admin sidebar section headings use 13px/18px medium (`AdminSidebar.css`), which is not one of the 12 text styles. Story-page labels use 12px/16px medium, which also matches no style (the Figma 12px styles use an 18px line height).
- `Avatar.css:18` uses 9px/13.5px for the small avatar. It is in Figma, but there is no text style for it.
- `Tabs.css` sets `font-weight` on its own in 3 places.

**Proposed fix (needs a yes):** add one CSS variable per text style, replace every literal font declaration with it, and decide the colors above (map each to the nearest token, or ask for tokens in Figma).

## 0a. Molecules (Patterns) and Table: open points (2026-10-07)

Check these when we go through each component.
- **Hover states are my own.** Figma draws no hover for the Admin sidebar, the Main nav or the Table row action buttons. Chosen: sidebar items `slateSurfaceSubtle100Hover`; nav icons `slateSurfaceDark600`; row action buttons `slateSurfaceSubtle100Hover`. Row action icon colour (`slateIconsActive`) and divider colour (`slateBorderLight`) are also assumed.
- **Admin sidebar spacing.** In Figma the AI group sits 4px further left than the other groups (heading at 8px, items without the 4px inset). I aligned all groups. Decide whether to match Figma exactly or fix Figma.
- **Main nav icons not in the icon set.** The Conversations inbox glyph and the help-in-chat glyph are drawn inside `MainNav.tsx` from Figma's shapes. They do not appear on the Icons page. Decide whether to add them to the Figma icon set.
- **Main nav avatar colour.** Figma shows a red avatar (Pastel Red). The Avatar component has only the light blue, so the nav uses the plain Avatar. Add a `color` prop to Avatar if red is wanted.
- **Table status toggle.** Uses our Switch, while Figma draws a lighter plain toggle.
- **Pill bolt icon.** The lightning bolt in the SLA pill and alert is not in the HOT icon set, so it is drawn inside `Bolt.tsx` (SLA) from the Figma shape (12px, from the original HOT Design System file). Decide whether to add it to the icon set. Overdue uses `errorSurfaceDisabled` as Figma binds it, an odd name for an active red.
- **Empty state icons are a separate 24px set.** The Figma empty states use 24px icons with a 2px outline (Untitled UI style), not the HOT 14/16px icons. They live in `src/patterns/EmptyState/emptyStateIcons.ts`, copied from Figma. Decide whether to merge them into the main icon set. The AI Agents icon is on a 20px grid and is drawn inline.
- **Empty state placeholder text.** Four Figma empty states still have placeholder text: Tags and Business hours ("small description"), No conversation found ("Have a description here") and Notifications ("Write a description here"). Kept as drawn. Needs real copy from the designer. Also: the Select-an-item state uses the open-mail icon.
- **Modal: not built yet.** Four of the 11 Figma modals: Add a note and AI Summarizer (they hold a rich note editor box with its own icon row and 28px buttons), Create a tag (needs a colour swatch picker) and Sign in with your own work email (a blue info block with a title, instead of the grey note). Needs the editor and swatch picker designed as their own components first.
- **Red button colour differs between Figma pages.** The Button page's Error button is the bright red (`errorBorderDefault`, #e42525), but the modals use the darker red (`errorSurfaceDefault`, #b81717). The modal overrides the Button to match its own frame. Decide which red is right and make the Button and modal agree.
- **Modal red button has no hover or pressed colour (removed for now).** In the Figma Error/Surface tokens, "Default" (#b81717) looks darker than "Dark" (#e8a0a0-ish light red), so the scale is back to front and there is no sensible darker colour to use on hover. Fix the Error/Surface token scale in the DS first, then add hover and pressed to the modal's red button (and check the Button page's Error button hover, which currently goes from the bright red to `errorSurfaceDefault`).
- **Modal: details to confirm.** Buttons in Figma are 36px tall, which is not one of our Button heights (28, 32, 40), so the modal overrides them to 36px. The scrim behind the modal and any shadow were not read from Figma (not drawn in the frames). The "Create a tag" header uses 20px side padding while the others use 16px; I used 16px. The radio group is 8px shorter than Figma's (our Radio group spacing), so the SLA Settings modal is 212px, not 220px. The Add Members field is drawn as a select-style input in Figma; I used a plain Input.
- **Main nav matches Omni_Master-Components, not the tokens (2026-10-07).** The nav is now 50px wide with the background `#2e3641`, copied from the Figma Main Nav in the Omni_Master-Components file (earlier it was 44px with `slateSurfaceDarkest`, `#334155`). `#2e3641` is not a token. Decide which dark colour is right and bind it to a token in Figma. The logo is the Omni_Master version (24 by 26.875), and the avatar is red (`pastelRedBorderDefault`) with a pale letter (`slateSurfaceSubtle300`) through new `--avatar-bg` support in Avatar. The hover colour (`slateSurfaceDark600`) is still my choice.
- **Conversations sidebar (2026-10-07).** Built from the Omni_Master-Components file. Hover and selected colours are my choice (same as the Admin sidebar): Figma only draws the closed, resting rows, and the component has more states (open inbox cards, an Active variant) that were not read. The plus-and-arrow button has a raw drop shadow (`rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`) copied from Figma. Four glyphs are not in the HOT icon set and are drawn from Figma in `src/patterns/glyphs.tsx`: the Voice phone, Spam, the large plus and the Conversations inbox (shared with the Main nav). The Personal row has a count in Figma but it is hidden (opacity 0).
- **Conversations sidebar: inbox views (2026-10-07).** Inbox rows open to show their views, built from the Figma Chat inbox cards. The behaviour (total when closed, arrow in its place on hover, no total when open, downward arrow on hover) comes from your description; Figma only draws the resting states. The arrow is the right chevron turned 90 degrees. Counts in the views are set in Inter in Figma; the sidebar uses the system font token (Hanken Grotesk) instead. The total caps at "99+" (my choice). Slack, Voice and Email use the same six views as Chat (Unassigned, Assigned to Bot, Mine, All Assigned, Tags, Closed), which is not confirmed. Two more glyphs are drawn in code (`unassigned` and `bot`, in `glyphs.tsx`) and are listed in section 0b.
- **Chat inbox icon updated (2026-10-07).** Replaced from the HOT Design System file (`chatinbox` at 14, 16 and 24px). It is now a speech circle with three dots. Check the Admin sidebar and empty states still look right with it.
- **Page layout: Home page (2026-10-07).** Widths: Main nav 50, sidebar 240 (Conversations sidebar and Admin sidebar are both 240), right panel 320, content flexible (830 on a 1440 page). The right panel is not built yet; the layout shows a grey placeholder. The page has no minimum width yet, so below roughly 700px the content gets very narrow. More layouts will be added as variants. **Admin panel variant (2026-10-07):** Main nav 50, Admin sidebar 240, sub-nav 240, content flexible (910 on a 1440 page), no right panel. The sub-nav is not built yet, so it is a grey placeholder in the story only; replace it with the real component when it exists.
- **Click ripple (2026-10-08).** Copied from the product's PrimeVue Ripple onto every Button variant (primary, secondary, filled, ghost, error, neutral, and icon-only) and the Tabs (`src/components/ripple`). Product values: a circle as wide as the longer side of the element, growing to 2.5x over 400ms (linear) while fading out, started at the click point. The product colour is black at 10%; here it is the darkest text token (`slateTextTitle`) at 10%, which is nearly identical. The product turns the ripple on for every PrimeVue button and menu item, so other components (List items, the Main nav, the sidebars) would ripple in the product but do not here.
- **Where the Button component is used, and where it is not (2026-10-08).** Now using Button: the Modal footer actions and its close button, the Table row actions, and the Conversations sidebar search button (all icon-only ghost, 28px, pulled in with negative margin to keep Figma's layout). The Modal close icon is now 16px (Figma: 14px) because the Button's icon slot is 16px. Still plain buttons because the Button cannot be used as is: the plus-and-arrow split button in the Conversations sidebar (needs a SplitButton), the Input "Copy"-style action (divided text action inside the field), the Tag remove cross (12px), the SLA alert bar when clickable (whole bar), and the rows and tabs (List item, Tabs, Main nav, sidebars), which are selectable rows rather than buttons. The Colors and Icons foundation pages have swatch buttons that are Storybook tools, not design system buttons.
- **Secondary button hover and click (2026-10-08).** Copied from the product's `secondary-outline` button: on hover the fill and border turn light grey; while it is pressed it keeps that look and the text stays dark. The product also keeps the grey and adds a soft shadow after a click until the button loses focus; both were left out on purpose. The product's grey is `#F4F5FA` (not a token); here it is `slateSurfaceSubtle100Hover` (`#f1f5f9`), the closest token. This replaces the Figma behaviour (blue text and blue border while pressed). The other button variants still use the Figma hover and pressed colours.
- **Admin sidebar icon choices.** Icons were matched by shape (for example Knowledge Hub = `file`, Apps = `apps1`). Confirm against the Figma icon names.

## 0b. Icons that are not in the DS icon set (started 2026-10-07)

These are drawn in code straight from Figma because the HOT icon set (14/16/24px, `src/icons`) does not have them. To deal with later: add each one to the DS icon page in Figma, regenerate the icons, and delete the local drawing. Keep adding to this list whenever a new one turns up.

| Icon | Size | Used in | Where it lives in code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lightning bolt | 12px, filled | SLA pill and SLA alert | `src/components/Sla/Bolt.tsx` |
| Conversations inbox (rounded box with a tray) | 16px | Main nav | `src/patterns/glyphs.tsx` (`inbox`) |
| Help in a speech bubble | 16px | Main nav footer | `src/patterns/glyphs.tsx` (`helpchat`) |
| Voice (phone with signal arcs) | 16px | Conversations sidebar | `src/patterns/glyphs.tsx` (`voice`) |
| Spam (alert in an octagon) | 16px | Conversations sidebar | `src/patterns/glyphs.tsx` (`spam`) |
| Unassigned (person with a question mark) | 16px | Conversations sidebar views | `src/patterns/glyphs.tsx` (`unassigned`) |
| Bot (robot head) | 16px | Conversations sidebar views | `src/patterns/glyphs.tsx` (`bot`) |
| Plus, large (the thin one in the plus/arrow button) | 16px | Conversations sidebar | `src/patterns/glyphs.tsx` (`plus`). The DS `add` icon is a smaller plus. |
| Success check circle | 44px, filled | Modal (Profile Updated), drawn in the story only | `src/patterns/Modal/Modal.stories.tsx` |
| AI Agents (robot head) | 20px grid | Empty state | `src/patterns/EmptyState/EmptyState.tsx` |
| Empty-state icon set: signature, templates, chat, email, slack, voice, tags, business hours, API, shared inbox, accounts, contacts, conversations, select (open mail), note, search, notification | 24px, 2px outline | Empty state | `src/patterns/EmptyState/emptyStateIcons.ts`. They look like Untitled UI icons. The DS icon set has many of these shapes at 14/16px but not at this 24px/2px size. |

Also not an icon but drawn in code: the Hiver logo in the Main nav (`MainNav.tsx`).

## 1. List item: standalone rows that are not in Figma

**Where:** Components → List item (Playground, Docs, All Variants). Files: `src/components/List/ListItem.stories.tsx`, `ListItem.mdx`.

**Problem:** the Figma "Lists" page only draws standalone rows with an avatar or with nothing on the left. The checkbox, radio and icon left elements exist in Figma only inside Dropdown rows. The standalone rows with a checkbox, radio or icon in the List item pages are my own compositions, not Figma designs. In the Playground, `leading: checkbox` is also always ticked and cannot be toggled.

**Proposed fix (needs a yes from the designer):** remove the checkbox, radio and icon options from the standalone List item Playground and Docs, so the page shows only what the Figma Lists page draws. Keep them working inside Dropdown, where Figma uses them.

**Related, already fixed on the same day:** rows with a description now show a chevron on the right (not a check), and a row with nothing on either side is 36px tall.

## Other open items from earlier in the work

- **Cross-check repeated components.** Compare the places where one component sits inside another against the original: Dropdown footer buttons vs Button, Dropdown search field vs Input, and anything else that repeats. Not started.
- **Radio rows in Dropdown.** They still get the grey row hover. The Radio page in Figma has no hover design, so there was nothing to match. Decide whether radio rows should behave like checkbox rows.
- **Dropdown selected state.** Figma does not show how a selected row looks in the plain, avatar and icon styles, so none is drawn.
- **Checkbox no longer follows the Figma Checkbox page.** By decision, it uses the dropdown checkbox interaction (thin grey border off, solid blue on, no hover or press change). The Figma Checkbox page has not been updated to match.
- **Not built yet:** Tags input and Phone input (they were waiting on Tag and Dropdown, which now exist), and Compact Button.
- **Figma file oddities, left as they are:** icon name typos (`calander`, `clipbord`, `massage`), near-duplicate icons, the invisible 100×100 frame in the Tab hover variant, hidden check and cross icons in every Switch variant, and a faint search icon colour in the Dropdown Menu radio style.
- **Unexplained "Storybook published!" message** seen in the first Storybook session. Nothing was published on purpose. Ask whether anyone clicked a publish or share option.
